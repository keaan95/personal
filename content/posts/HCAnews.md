After three medical school rejections (yet to hear from Southampton), I've decided to apply for full-time healthcare assistant work. I've applied to four different posts (Orthopaedics at one Hospital, two community based clinics and Emergency Department at another Hospital).

News from today is that I have a conditional offer of appointment to be a Healthcare Assistant in the Emergency Department!

Had an interview last week and the nurses were extremely kind and warming. Along with a few standard questions on your past and what you plan to do, I also had questions on ethical scenarios and thankfully, I could think more coherently and articulate myself better than I did at my medical school interview and fortunately, I got a job offer.

Sheer relief that ethics and interview practice has paid off and I'm extremely excited to now proudly become an NHS employee.

 And so hopefully this begins a long career in hospital-based healthcare. Medical school applications await in upcoming months but healthcare assistant work is something new to look forward to.
