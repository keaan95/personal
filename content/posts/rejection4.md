Southampton rejection pre-interview.

<!--more-->

And that wraps up my 2017 Entry Cycle application. Unfortunately, it seems that a low admissions score was the culprit this cycle. But my scores have improved from last year and I don't particularly feel any less determined to get in. If anything, I know I'm close. Just need to get myself in as many interview rooms as I can next year. And so, preparation for 2018 Entry shall begin soon. Armed with fresh ambition, a renewed personal statement and hopefully better a better admissisions test score, we'll have another crack at trying to get in. 

Just one more teaching week, two more essays and a 10,000 word dissertation left in my Cambridge Masters degree. My dissertation deadline is on the 31st July. I will find out my startdate for healthcare assistant work soon but I hope to start, at the very least, before submitting my next UCAS application.

The immediate outlook is up. More experience through hospitals, clinical practice and being around medical personnel will help me adopt a more clinical mindset that should help me through interviews. After one interview this year, I know I am close.

But one day I will get in and that day will be a special day.
