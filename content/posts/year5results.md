Utter relief earlier this month.

WRISKE (76%) - Okay so I gave a kid a constipation disimpaction regime and probably wise to check lithium levels in a suspected lithium toxicity patient. But otherwise solid actually.

MOSLER (76%)

- Station 1: Why did this patient end up an ITU and arrest? Turns out it was sepsis secondary to pneumonia. A uniquely put-together station but that shouldn't really change things. Just focus on the now and then the past. So long as you signpost, you'll demonstrate to the examiner that vaguely know what you're talking about

- Station 2: Hx of abdominal pain out of the blue with no obvious risk factors. Ischaemic colitis. Bit rogue but surgeons will love a surgical case.

- Station 3: Asthma technqiue. Paeds doctors are a joy to have examine you. There's just a comforting air already in the room.

- Station 4: Mania in ED. Yeah so apparently you stop an SSRI in mania? My plan discuss with senior. 

- Station 5: Why did this patient get non-cardiac sounding chest pain? Infection? Valve pathology? Mets from a previous cancer? Just whack out a chest exam and check lymph nodes probs.

- Station 6: IBD review. Nutrition and complex meds management? Nah, refer colorectal MDT / speak to senior.

- Station 7: PCOS. *Slowly* palpate and check the patient's facial expression. I was guilty of this on a WR with the consultant as an F1.

- Station 8: ACS Management simulation. Tried to sound like a smartass by saying I would like a D-dimer but hold onto it for now. But hey escalated once I saw the STEMI so safe-ish.

And that wrapped up Year 5.

Funnily enough every year I was consistently in the 6th decile and I thought would that impact my performance as an F1? Two months into being an F1, the answer is honestly no. So long as you're aware of what to do when something looks wrong or a patient looks unwell, you'll be a good F1.

Yes, this report was 5 months late. But what a year its been and there's still two months left!
