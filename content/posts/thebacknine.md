Had Halfway Dinner last Tuesday. A well put on occassion at Girton actually where 2nd year undergraduate, 2nd year PhDs and 1st year MPhils come together for a formal dinner. It reminded me of Matriculation Dinner when everything felt so new and exciting. New people to meet. Lots of alcohol to plunge into and another lifting speech by the Mistress.

Results from my opening two Modules are back:

- 71% - Introduction to Genomics
- 61% - Genomic Sequencing Methods

The 61% was a painful one. Especially when seeing all your fellow students are consistently hitting 75%+. Feedback and comments were deserved but still very frustrating to read nonetheless. I felt as if I had written as good an essay as I've written previously but my grasp of the title meant '80% of the essay is irrelevant.' Onto the next assignment.

And onto happier days. As today, feeling a lot more relaxed and calm about my work and the future. Having spoken to a close friend (now an MPhil student) on whether failing to get into Cambridge as an undergraduate motivated him. His response was love of the subject motivated him.
That is what I need. Just to love my work again. Take it day by day and maybe, just maybe, I will love the journey I'm on. And just as it did with my friend, that will help build the person I want to become.
