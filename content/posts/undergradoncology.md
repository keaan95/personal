Friday Evening at 7pm. We're off to Cambridge for a Poster Presentation at the Cambridge University Oncology Society Conference. Short delay at Peterborough provided enough time to join in the Academic Medicine Society Committee Video Call - plans for the Conference are being mapped out. Great to give back on some of my experiences from the year before to students now planning their first Conference. Otherwise, just flicking through Reproductive Health notes from the day before. Sister messages me ask 'You coming to Cambo?!?!' Oh dear [she's a NatSci Graduate from Churchil College]. Navigating through this leads to a shared agreement that I will pop in to see here in Wagamama with her boyfriend.

Friday Evening at 7.30pm. Arriving at Cambridge Train Station. Lots of suitcases but I'm here with a rucksack and poster rolled up. Drop off the kit at Travelodge and head on down to Wagamama. Spot my sister and her boyfriend. Good catch-up. Otherwise, I'm out of here. Subway down the street does me just fine. Head back upstairs to finishing preparations for my Poster Presentation tomorrow.

Saturday. Conference Day. Lots of attendees (~60). Poster presentation at 12pm with a 3 minute poster speech. Went well. Hit the major points I wanted to cover over two months of hard work in Machine Learning Classifers ofa high-risk of tumour relapse subtype of ALL. I felt it was also important to comment on the limitations of the research - glaringly obvious to those actively involved in machine learning algorithms. On announcement of prizes, I was not one of them. This was honestly to be expected after recognising my limitations. After a Costa Coffee and WhatsApp message to the family, significant reasons to remain optimistic. Leeds Conference in Medical Education in March is the next one.
