The sun is out. Springtime in Newcastle has never seemingly looked so good in early February.

A relaxing weekend back home also included a trip back to Cambridge to visit the old stomping grounds - Wolfson Court. Sadly, it is in a early stage of disrepair after losing down just after we all left. Three of the Girton Boys are motoring on with PhDs, two are in employment and one is at Medical School (me). PhD students have the unique responsibility of supervising young undergraduate students. From this, it was insightful to appreciate that students can come up with perspectives that are different to the supervisor. These perspectives come from a deeper understanding of the topic area - not simply regurgitating slide material. Over the last five and a half years of university, I have been guilty of this. Taking material, revising material and synthesising material into a mental model or carefully crafted essay has been my staple. Taking a step back and thinking about the deeper reasons for why situations are occuring in the way in which they are is an area I have not particularly thought about - providing time for yourself.

Something to think about in the future.
