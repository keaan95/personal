Blogs are so brilliantly relateable. How else are you gonna find someone going through the same of emotions and circumstances whilst you're tucked up in your Lockdown Room sipping on Instant Cappucino. Long live the blog.

For me this, all began as I have a lot fire from my Biomedical Science degree. At lot of people counted me out including tutors. I just simply just wanted to get into Medicine. But if I didn't and my tutors were somehow provided right, at least I would be thorough in documenting the reasons why. Maybe someone else could do things a bit different and a bit better in their own journey.

**Inspirational Blogs**

A blog called 'Grumpy Biomed' - a diary of a quintessential Biomedical Science student dreaming of studying medicine was read by me over 20 times perhaps. This was a time when YouTube videos did not exist on the matter. He also did a postgraduate masters but eventually got into Warwick for the 2011/12 Academic Year. There really wasn't anyone else who chronicled their feelings so regularly, beautifully and so relateably. That blog has since sadly been deleted and his follow-up medical school blog has gone too.

Last week, I came across Paeds Registrar who has just been awarded a Paeds Oncology Training Post. She has chronicled all her stories back to the penultimate year of medical school. A treasure trove of relateable emotion unlike these Productive Junior Doctor Gurus.

**My Projects**

I got the HLA Scholarship! Since then, my project on 'better understanding how prepared future doctors are to work with AI' picked up one of the Best Poster Prizes at the November Conference. I actually thought I missed the deadline to submit but it was a delightful surprise and a great boost of energy to continue to build my project. Lots of exciting themes to come soon - Surveys, Journal Clubs, Virtual Electives and hopefully an article that might be published one day!

**Why you should join the HLA? - I'm not paid or urged to say this - its just really good.**

So many incredible people exist within this organisation - high output academics, publically vocal juniors and healthcare professioanls across seemingly every specialty and subspecialty. It is a really rich source of human talent. The educational sessions are unbelievably inspiring. They will give feedback on exactly how they see it, there's no veil of politeness, this is what you could have done.The opportunities within this organisation are plentiful. As one scholar once said, once you're part of the HLA, you never really leave. It certainly does seem true.

**Principles of Learning**

One of the other things the HLA has helped me appreciate is people's perspectives. How people think on the reverse or blind-side?

Reverse: Say you're trying to implement a campaign advocating for structured breaks in junior doctor shifts? We all agree it should occur but why does it not occur? Okay, there are issues beyond our control and even if mandated, why would we not take breaks? So the bigger question is how do we encourage breaks? This series of repeated questions of why turns eventually into a how - how can we improve.

Blind: Say you've got a junior doctor ward who are always busy and seemingly stressed. How can you improve their lives? Is it because they're short-staffed? Is it because there are too few nurses? Is it because they are unprepared? If it is because they're short-staffed? Why is this occuring? How can we improve this? What could be our plan? In this case, the solution is not obvious but be can help our cause by asking lots of follow-up questions and deducing a key question.

I think one thing I've learnt this term, particularly when at revision sessions for Finals, is taking things back to first principles 1) identifying assumptions 2) breaking down the problem 3) creating new solutions.

e.g. do Medical Students need to know about Coding skills?

1. Wait why would they even need to know?

2. Personal projects, research projects, they will not be troubleshooting big organisational software programmes.

3. How can we encourage positive uptake of coding skills as means of encouraging students to further their interest in particular careers e.g. oncology?
