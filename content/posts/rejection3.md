From Leicester this time. Unfortunately, my UKCAT score failed to offset my poor A-level results in their points-based application process. Harsh reality to face.

Last Saturday, went to London to a MedicPortal organised MMI circuit to gain experience with MMIs and it was absolutely worthwhile. I certainly have a more focal view of the areas of which I now need to improve. Those areas being primarily communication skills, understanding of modern medical issues and ethical dilemmas and showing confidence in your response. With only a need to brush up on some basic physiology, the main areas that I need to improve in are no longer academical.

And it is the time of year when PhD interviews are taking place and it has been a consideration for me. Do I see myself enjoying the challenge of a PhD and perhaps a clear career path involving what I have learnt afterwards? It is an option. However, at this time, I believe is not one that would help me improve the areas in which I need to improve in for medical school. A career in clinical medicine remains my long-term goal. Several areas about myself and my character need to be improve and I principally believe they centre around me showing as much confidence to others as I know I have in my own ability to improve.

The day of nailing that interview is coming. Just be ready.
