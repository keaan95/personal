Two days ago, I received an invitation to an interview for 2017 Entry from Newcastle. This is for the five year programme having originally applied to them earlier this year.

The interview was today and this was actually a phone-based panel interview with two selectors. So I've been trying to cover as much ground for the interview and particularl panel-based topics whilst also addressing some of the areas in which I did not perform so well in at the panel-based Plymouth interview.

The interview was scheduled for 20 minutes and it went by extremely quickly. The questions were very generic and open-ended. On reflection, I felt that the themes of my responses addressed the questions well but I think I could have delivered the content a bit more succinctly. I felt quite nervous initially when questions were asked based on the content of my responses. The interviewers were very straight-faced and professional so it was hard to tell if these questions were answered properly with strong conviction. Collectively, I felt that I had improved from the Plymouth interview but will this improvement lead to a medical school place?

Ultimately, there are areas in which I know I need to improve in. Particularly around preparing myself for questions ensuring that I answer questions concisely. Current work as a healthcare assistant is proving to be particularly useful in understanding a variety of hospital-based protocols but also understanding how to interact and communicate with medical professionals and patients. I feel confident that increased clinical exposure will particularly help in improving communication skills.
