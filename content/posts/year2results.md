Great sight to see! New record highs in OSCE, SBA and Coursework has definitely been pleasing. A drop in SAP is possibly a reflection of a greater commitment to the SBA (weighted more).

A tough year. That is another takeaway. A rise from mid-pack to the top ranked students requires a real plan at the start of the year. A plan that is an evolution from the previous year. Learning this has been tough to take but I'm glad I've taken it.

Throughout the second half, I felt that this year was really about commitment. How badly do you want it. Across all my years at university, you really have to get out of bed every morning feeling like there is nowhere else I would rather be.

*And for the reason why this is two weeks late:*

After those long January mornings, hunger is running high. Late June and its a very mild Summer Evening. Summer Research Project is two weeks in. Lots of plots, lots of preparation and lots more to learn. This level of hunger really is very similar to my first Summer Research Project in Plymouth '13. Back then, I was a passenger - developing my project under the direct guidance of a supervisor. This time, I'm the driver - developing my project independently with assistance of supervisors. More responsibility. More devotion. More care required.

Seeing how badly things have fallen to rescuing my ranking is pleasing but more can definitely come.

For now, bed for an early start to prepare my data presentations!
