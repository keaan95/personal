We are officially two-thirds into this nine year projected voyage through university. That means just three years left to complete some goals. The next one - a first author publication.

Simply what a time to be doing some summer research. Navigating my through datasets, near identical in structure to when this journey began back in 2013-14. Since then, the methods to tackle the data are more developed and more methods are more available. Simply, more avenues of attack. More excitement. More expectation. More of a chance to finally convert this opportunity.

It all begins with an abstract and ends with a disclosure of conflicting interests. I have none.
Nine years at university with no first-author publication. That will not be me.
