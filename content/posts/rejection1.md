Well it has been coming. In my gut, felt as if I did not perform as well as I would have liked at my Plymouth interview. Combination of nerves and inability to express myself through past experiences did not help. I did feel as if I coped better with the ethical scenario that Plymouth allow you to devote time to prepare beforehand but for the impromptu ethical situations, I could not think as laterally or quickly as I would have liked. It is certainly harder in a panel interview to give more a practical representation of how you are rather than describing how you would act theoretically.

It was a great learning experience nonetheless. I still have the drive and enthusiasm to get to Medical School. I will certainly be looking for more additional interview practice through my university, careers department and other companies. As I prepare more, I think I will show myself as being more naturally confident which undoubtedly will help. I think I am coming close. A Plymouth reunion is off though.
