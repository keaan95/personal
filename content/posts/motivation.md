So this is the beginning hopefully of more prosperous times than last year. A First Class degree and Acceptance onto a Master's degree at Cambridge was great but still I have yet to achieve my primary goal on leaving school. Get into Medical School.

So this is the beginning hopefully of more prosperous times than last year. A First Class degree and Acceptance onto a Master's degree at Cambridge was great but still I have yet to achieve my primary goal on leaving school. Get into Medical School.

Ever since that fateful day when I realised I would finish my school years with BCC as my A-Levels, the clock was ticking. It was time to prove just how badly I wanted to do Medicine and how badly I wanted to work to achieve it. But never did I want to experience failure like that again.

My undergraduate degree really helped prove to myself that I can compete. After the first year of my undergraduate degree, I finished with just under a 69% average. After not particularly working hard that year, it was very reinforcing to me that with a little more application, I can go on and be one of the best students in my degree cohort.

That all changed in the final year of my undergraduate degree when I was unfortunately predicted a 2:1 despite a 73% average during second year. It meant instant rejection from Plymouth University and quite likely hindered my other applications elsewhere. That was hard for me but it wasn't the first time my tutor did not believe in me.

On the final day (Leaver's Day) at school, our housemaster typically delivers a short speech on each of the leavers to the entire house. I was second in the alphabet and his opening words were: '[my name], he lacks common sense.' Never will I forget those words. But forever will I try and prove him wrong by moving onto a career where, perhaps, above all, is common sense expected the most.

After rocky roads of my UKCAT and GAMSAT in 2015, I'll be submitting my UCAS application tonight armed with a slightly better UKCAT score in 2016. I just hope I have an opportunity to prove myself at an interview. Its coming one day. Just be ready.
