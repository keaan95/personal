This is unofficially the middle of the first year of my Medical Degree at Newcastle University. We have 13 different cases and we are currently halfway through the sixth. October and January exams have come and been passed. I am currently the 223rd ranked student out of 454 medical students across both Newcastle and Malaysia campuses. That places me roughly in the middle of the pack.

This is also the middle point of my projected nine year university voyage and a convenient time to reflect on what has happened previously and what is to come now.

Certainly the first four years have proved that I can be great, galvanise opinion, become an effective team leader and understand critical situations.

But of course, a few failures remain including the lack of a publication, becoming president of a society and never finishing at the top of my degree class.

Those still linger as I am currently at the halfway point but I feel very clear about the end-goal at this point in my medical school career. All that needs doing now is to put in the work.
