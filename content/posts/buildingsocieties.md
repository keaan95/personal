Its the end of the first term of my first clinical year at Newastle University. Been exciting to get on the wards for the first time. Experience a close to full length day with nurses, junior doctors, core trainees and consultants in a variety of wards and departments. Different places, different people, different ward-based cultures.

And now as the Christmas break begins, its also a time to catch-up on society events planning - Academic Medicine Society, Haematology-Oncology Society and Emergency Medicine Society.

Each of these three societies have three distinct cultures.

*Academic Medicine* - A research interested society committee with growing experience. A flexible President keen to empower other committee members.

*Haematology-Oncology* - A new society with lots of clinical year members. An easy-going President happy to support the plans of other committee members.

*Emergency Medicine* - An empire of a society thats put on incredibly well-designed patient-based simulations every fortnight. A passionate committee that previously included later clinical year students now features many highly committed pre-clinical and early clinical students.

As a consequence of being involved in some societies and cultures is the importance of understanding your role. Your role as a leader and as a team player. Being able to switch mindset between the two in orderto meet the challenges of each society. In an aging society, cultivating enthusiasm. In a society with lots of new members, encouraging interaction. In a large powerful society, navigating sub-cultures within the society. These are all fluid challenges that require continued commitment.
