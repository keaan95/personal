Halfway Dinner of my Masters Degree at Cambridge tomorrow. Just 4 Assignments and a 10,000 word Thesis await. Plans for life after Cambridge are underway.

Last week, submitted an application towards Healthcare Assistant work at a hospital nearby to where I live in South-West London. Quite keen on working and immersing myself in an NHS hospital. Experiences there will definitely help for future interviews in being able to reflect upon areas in which I have learnt and improved upon.

That also means PhD applications will wait. The goal very much remains Medical School. A PhD thereafter is a significant possibility, especially knowing my research will be within a specialty I plan to practise in.

Significant personal development also must take place. 

1. Not just having confidence in your own ability but exuding that confidence and placing that confidence in others to believe in you.
2. Communication skills. Thinking more simply. Not trying to be overly articulate.
3. Calmness under pressure. Never letting anything fluster you or your ability to perform.

Those three areas are the key qualities that I feel make a great clinician but also a great quarterback. Tom Brady won his fifth Super Bowl ring last night. A guy who rose to the top of his field from absolute obscurity, fuelled with opinions of his doubters. That is the story of the Comeback Kid.
