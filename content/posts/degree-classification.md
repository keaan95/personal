Four months on and I have successfully completed my BSc Biomedical Science degree with my final year module marks are as follows:
<!--more-->

   Module | Score
--------|------ 
  Personal Research Project | 72.34%
  Molecular and Cellular Pathology | 74.17%
  Specialist Biochemistry and Screening | 79.13%
  Current Developments in Biomedical Science | 68.25%
  Medical Genetics | 75.21%

And those marks wrap up a First Class Degree Classification which I am certainly very pleased about. For the first time, I finally have the academic criteria box firmly ticked. A third attempt at the UKCAT awaits and I am also close to finding out about my Masters application. Exciting times ahead.
