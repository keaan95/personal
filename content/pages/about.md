# A doctor in-training

I'm a fourth year medical student at Newcastle University.

I'm particularly interested in cancer genomics, machine learning and data visualisation. I currently:

- Lead an educational intiative exploring how machine learning is currently impacting oncology ([DoctorX.co.uk ðŸ§¬](http://www.doctorx.co.uk/) )
- Lead a charity that helps science graduates get into medicine and research ([BioToMed.com ðŸ’Š](http://www.biotomed.com/))
- Encourage medical students to become better prepared for emergencies ([NEMSOC.com ðŸ’‰](http://www.nemsoc.com/)).
